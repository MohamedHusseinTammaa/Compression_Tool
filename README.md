# Huffman Coding Compression Tool


c# program that compresse files size using huffman algorithm.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

1. **Algorithm Design:**
   - Implemented Huffman Coding from scratch.
   - Gained insights into tree-based algorithms and how they optimize data compression.

2. **File Handling:**
   - Acquired skills in reading and writing binary files, crucial for managing large datasets.

3. **Compression Techniques:**
   - Mastered encoding and decoding processes, including bitwise operations and handling padding.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Tackled challenges related to file encoding and Unicode, enhancing my debugging abilities.

5. **Code Organization:**
   - Focused on writing clean, well-documented code, which is vital for maintaining and scaling projects.

## How This Helps Me

- **Improved Problem-Solving:** Mastered new algorithms and techniques for efficient data handling.
- **Enhanced Skills:** Gained practical experience in file I/O and data compression, applicable to real-world scenarios.
- **Better Practices:** Improved my ability to write clear and maintainable code, beneficial for future projects.

This project has been a valuable learning experience, strengthening my skills as a software engineer. I am excited to apply these concepts to future projects!

## How It Works

1. **Compression (Encoding):**
   - Provides a way to compress a file using Huffman Coding.
   - Generates a compressed version of the file with a new name prefixed by "Encoded_".

2. **Decompression (Decoding):**
   - Allows you to decompress a previously compressed file.
   - Generates a decompressed file with a new name prefixed by "Decoded_".


## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## How To Use It 

1. **Open the Project**:
- Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.

2. **Build and Run**:
- Build the project and run the executable. You will be prompted to enter the path of the file you want to work on and choose whether to compress or decompress the file.

3. **Enter File Path**:

- Provide the full path to the file you wish to process.

4. **Choose Operation**:

- Enter c to compress the file.
- Enter d to decompress the file

## Example 
```bash
ENTER THE PATH OF THE FILE THAT YOU WANT TO WORK ON : E:\\Git projects\\huffman\\file.txt
ENTER 'c' IF YOU WANT TO COMPRESS THE FILE
ENTER 'd' IF YOU WANT TO EXTRACT THE FILE
